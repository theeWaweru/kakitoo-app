        <p className="tos-text">
          4.1 You may use the Kakitoo only to send a Transfer to a Reciever
          located in a country where Kakitoo provides the service as described
          below.
          <br />
          <br />
          4.2 Your use of the Service does not create a fiduciary or escrow
          relationship between you and Kakitoo. Kakitoo only provides a transfer
          service; the funds you direct to Kakitoo to pay to the Receiver are
          not held as a deposit or in escrow by Kakitoo, and Kakitoo is not
          acting as a fiduciary in holding or processing your Transfer.
          Kakitoo&apos;s only obligation is to pay your Transfer to the Receiver or
          return the Transfer&apos;s principal amount to you.
          <br />
          <br />
          4.3 The Service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, although
          there may be times when the Service is unavailable to you or to the
          Receiver. Periods of unavailability may be caused by Kakitoo ’s own
          acts (such as temporary periods when the Service is taken off-line to
          make upgrades or improvements), or by events beyond Kakitoo ’s
          control, such as power outages, telecommunications failures, war or
          civil unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God. Kakitoo may from
          time to time set limits on the value of Transfers you may send (both
          individually and over a period of time), as well as the value of
          Transfers any Reciever may receive. Kakitoo may delay payment of your
          Transfer to allow Kakitoo to determine that your Transfer complies
          with applicable law, regulation or Kakitoo policies. Kakitoo has the
          right, without notice to you, to refuse to accept or pay any Transfer
          that Kakitoo determines in our sole discretion may violate applicable
          law, regulation or our policies, including laws, regulations and
          policies intended to help detect and prevent money-laundering,
          terrorist financing, fraud, and other abuses of financial services; if
          we accept a Transfer and then determine that it may violate any such
          law, regulation or policy, we may hold the Transfer until such time
          that the matter is resolved.

          information that you provide, including information about the
          Receiver. You acknowledge that any errors in the information you
          provide, including misidentification of Receiver(s), incorrect or
          inconsistent account names and numbers, or misspellings, are your

          The Kakitoo service is generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
          week, 365 days a year. Generally, the Receiver is paid instantly
          through the Kakitoo service; accordingly, once you originate a
          Transfer, you may be unable to stop or change it. If ever there is a
          situation where your transaction is not delivered instantly to the
          Receiver, we will contact you and keep you informed about the delay.

          Account. If a Receiver does not have a MoMo Account, the Transfer
          Payment funds will be returned to your MoMo Account.
          <br />
          <br />
          8.2 Kakitoo reserves the right to impose identification and
          verification requirements on a Receiver in order for them to receive a
          Transfer. When paying the Receiver, Kakitoo may rely on identification
          information or documentation provided by you or the Receiver,
          including any code or identifier number of the Transfer, without
          further investigation. Kakitoo reserves the right to refuse payment to
          the Receiver if Kakitoo cannot verify the Receiver&apos;s identity or if
          Kakitoo believes you or the Receiver are in violation of this
          Agreement or any applicable law, regulation, or Kakitoo policy.
          Although Kakitoo has the right to establish identification and
          verification requirements, and failure to comply with them is grounds
          for declining payment of the Transfer, Kakitoo has no obligation to
          establish any such requirements.
